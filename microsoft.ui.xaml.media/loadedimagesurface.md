# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Media.LoadedImageSurface

## -description
Represents a composition surface that an image can be downloaded, decoded and loaded onto. You can load an image using a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that references an image source file, or supplying a [IRandomAccessStream](/uwp/api/windows.storage.streams.irandomaccessstream).

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks
A **LoadedImageSurface** can be sourced from these image file formats:

* Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG)
* Portable Network Graphics (PNG)
* Bitmap (BMP)
* Graphics Interchange Format (GIF)
* Tagged Image File Format (TIFF)
* JPEG XR
* Icons (ICO)

> [!NOTE] **LoadedImageSurface** does not support animated GIF images, so only the first frame of an animated GIF will be shown.

If the image source is a stream, that stream is expected to contain an image file in one of these formats.

### LoadedImageSurface encoding and decoding
The underlying codec support for image files is supplied by Windows Imaging Component (WIC) API in Windows. For more info on specific image formats as documented for the codes, see
[Native WIC Codecs](/windows/desktop/wic/native-wic-codecs).

Using one of the factory methods, you can create an instance of **LoadedImageSurface** from different types of image sources and control the max size that the image decodes at. If 
no max size is specified, then the image will decode to its natural size.

* [StartLoadFromUri(Uri)](loadedimagesurface_startloadfromuri_1520650003.md)
* [StartLoadFromUri(Uri, Size)](loadedimagesurface_startloadfromuri_2119955733.md)
* [StartLoadFromStream(IRandomAccessStream)](loadedimagesurface_startloadfromstream_1253534602.md)
* [StartLoadFromStream(IRandomAccessStream, Size)](loadedimagesurface_startloadfromstream_1850726798.md)

### Lifetime management
When a **LoadedImageSurface** is created using one of the factory methods, the underlying surface is immediately initialized to a size of 0x0 and the image content begins
downloading and decoding off of the UI thread. When the image source has been successfully decoded, it then gets loaded onto the surface and the [LoadCompleted](loadedimagesurface_loadcompleted.md) event gets fired
when the surface has been populated. During the loading process, the surface will get resized from 0x0 to its final size based on the decoded size of the image source.

**LoadedImageSurface** automatically retains all of its resources until it loses its final reference. However, you may explicitly dispose of its resources through the [Close](loadedimagesurface_close_811482585.md) method.

> [!NOTE] **LoadedImageSurface** is not available prior to Windows 10, version 1703. If your app's 'minum platform version' setting in Microsoft Visual Studio is less
> than the 'introduced version' shown in the Requirements block later in this page, you cannot use this class.

## -examples
This example shows how to load an image from a local URI onto a surface and use it in a [CompositionSurfaceBrush](../microsoft.ui.composition/compositionsurfacebrush.md).

```csharp
Compositor compositor = new Compositor();
CompositionSurfaceBrush imageBrush = compositor.CreateSurfaceBrush();

LoadedImageSurface loadedSurface = LoadedImageSurface.StartLoadFromUri(new Uri("ms-appx:///Assets/myPic.jpg"), new Size(200.0, 400.0));

// The loadedSurface currently has a size of 0x0 since it has not been downloaded, decoded and loaded to the surface yet
imageBrush.Surface = loadedSurface;
```
