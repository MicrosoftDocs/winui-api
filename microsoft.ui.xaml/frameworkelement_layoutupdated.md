# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.FrameworkElement.LayoutUpdated

## -description
Occurs when the layout of the visual tree changes, due to layout-relevant properties changing value or some other action that refreshes the layout.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<frameworkElement LayoutUpdated="eventhandler"/>
 
```


## -remarks
LayoutUpdated is the last object lifetime event to occur in the XAML load sequence before a control is ready for interaction. However, LayoutUpdated can also occur at run time during the object lifetime, for a variety of reasons: a property change, a window resizing, or a runtime layout request ([UpdateLayout](uielement_updatelayout_1243658106.md) or a changed control template). The LayoutUpdated event is fired after all [SizeChanged](frameworkelement_sizechanged.md) events in a layout sequence occur.

LayoutUpdated can occur when the object where the handler is attached does not necessarily change anything in the visual tree under it. For instance, imagine a layout container where there are two child elements sharing space. If the first object changes a property that forces a new layout, both objects fire LayoutUpdated because the second object might be repositioned even if its own subsidiary layout does not change.

When you handle LayoutUpdated, do not rely on the *sender* value. For LayoutUpdated, *sender* is always **null**, regardless of where the handler is attached. This is to prevent handlers from assigning any meaning to *sender*, such as implying that it was that specific element that fired the event out of the visual tree. LayoutUpdated implies that something in the overall visual tree has changed, and each specific object anywhere in the tree has the option of handling this occurrence. If you're familiar with lower-level render API design, you can equate LayoutUpdated being fired as similar to a "redraw needed" flag being set as part of an object-driven, retained-mode rendering logic.

Because LayoutUpdated fires in many circumstances and isn't always specific to an object that actually changes, consider whether handling the [SizeChanged](frameworkelement_sizechanged.md) event instead is more appropriate for your scenario.


<!--The following remark is relevant for Windows 8 > 8.1 migration. See WBB 454659-->
### Windows 8 behavior

Windows 8 had an issue with keeping track of multiple listeners for this event. If you had multiple listeners/handlers for the event, attempting to remove one of them would result in removing all of them. The issue is corrected starting with Windows 8.1; removing event handlers using the `-=` syntax correctly removes only one listener at a time. Most code won't need changes or behavior checks because dealing with multiple listeners per event is an uncommon scenario.

Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 continue to use the Windows 8 behavior.
