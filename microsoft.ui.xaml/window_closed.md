# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.Closed

## -description
Occurs when the window has closed.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks
The Closed event occurs when a [Window](window.md) closes. 

For UWP apps, if this was the last window to be closed for the app, the Suspending event will be raised. In both Desktop and UWP apps, the application will end.
