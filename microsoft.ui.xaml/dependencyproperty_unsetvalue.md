# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.DependencyProperty.UnsetValue

## -description
Specifies a static value that is used by the property system rather than **null** to indicate that the property exists, but does not have its value set by the property system or by any app code.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -property-value
The sentinel value for an unset value.

## -remarks
UnsetValue is a sentinel value that is used for scenarios where the dependency property system is unable to determine a requested dependency property value. UnsetValue is used rather than **null**, because **null** is a valid property value for most reference-type values, and is a frequently used [DefaultValue](propertymetadata_defaultvalue.md) in metadata for a dependency property.

UnsetValue is never returned out of a [DependencyObject.GetValue](dependencyobject_getvalue_229640130.md) call. When you call [DependencyObject.GetValue](dependencyobject_getvalue_229640130.md) for a dependency property, one of these conditions is always true:
+ A dependency property has a default value established in metadata and that value is returned. This value might come from the property metadata's [DefaultValue](propertymetadata_defaultvalue.md). This might be **null**.
+ Some other value was established through value precedence (for example a style was applied, or a [Binding](../microsoft.ui.xaml.data/binding.md) was evaluated), and the default value is no longer relevant. Even though specifically set, this still might be **null**. For more info on value precedence, see [Dependency properties overview](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/dependency-properties-overview).


[DependencyObject.ReadLocalValue](dependencyobject_readlocalvalue_1526948202.md) returns UnsetValue when the requested property has not been locally set.



> [!NOTE]
> Do not register a dependency property with the default value of UnsetValue. This will be confusing for property consumers and will have unintended consequences within the property system.


<!--<rem  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance">Comment out don't think this applies. UnsetValue has a special meaning when used as the return value of a property changed callback.</rem>-->
UnsetValue should be returned from an [IValueConverter](../microsoft.ui.xaml.data/ivalueconverter.md) implementation that provides conversion in a data binding to a dependency property, in any case where the converter is unable to convert a source value. Converters shouldn't throw exceptions for that case in [IValueConverter.Convert](../microsoft.ui.xaml.data/ivalueconverter_convert_101701969.md), these will surface as run-time exceptions that you'd need to add handling for in [UnhandledException](application_unhandledexception.md) or worse yet appear to users as actual run-time exceptions. Converter implementations should follow the general binding pattern that any failed binding does nothing and does not provide a value, and UnsetValue rather than **null** is the sentinel value for that case that the binding engine understands. For more info, see [Data binding in depth](/windows/uwp/data-binding/data-binding-in-depth).

## -examples
This example checks for an existing local value with [ReadLocalValue](dependencyobject_readlocalvalue_1526948202.md). If there is a local value, as indicated by not returning UnsetValue, then the existing local value is removed by calling [ClearValue](dependencyobject_clearvalue_171358816.md).
