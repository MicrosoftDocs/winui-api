# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.GettingFocus

## -description

Occurs before a [UIElement](uielement.md) receives focus. This event is raised synchronously to ensure focus isn't moved while the event is bubbling.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -xaml-syntax

```xaml
<uiElement GettingFocus="eventhandler"/>
```

## -remarks

We recommend using the [UIElement](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement.md) focus routed events instead of [FocusManager](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/focusmanager.md) events whenever possible.

Only a single UI element at a time can have focus.

A control can get focus when another control loses focus, the application view changes, the user switches applications, or the user interacts with the system such that the application is no longer in the foreground.

When programmatically navigating between elements, [FocusNavigationDirection.Previous](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/focusnavigationdirection.md) and [FocusNavigationDirection.Next](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/focusnavigationdirection.md) cannot be used with [FindNextElementOptions](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/findnextelementoptions.md). Only [FocusNavigationDirection.Up](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/focusnavigationdirection.md), [FocusNavigationDirection.Down](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/focusnavigationdirection.md), [FocusNavigationDirection.Left](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/focusnavigationdirection.md), or [FocusNavigationDirection.Right](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/focusnavigationdirection.md) are valid.

GettingFocus is a routed event. For more info on the routed event concept, see [Events and routed events overview](/windows/uwp/xaml-platform/events-and-routed-events-overview).
