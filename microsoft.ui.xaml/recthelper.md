# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.RectHelper

## -description

Provides helper methods to evaluate or set [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect) values. C**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

# and Microsoft Visual Basic code should use members of [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect) instead.

## -remarks

 [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect) is a Windows Runtime structure that represents a rectangle's dimensions with an origin.

RectHelper is one of several **Helper** classes that are intended to provide utility methods for Windows Runtime structure values. C# and Microsoft Visual Basic code can use members of [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect) instead, because utility members are available directly on the structure due to .NET Framework runtime support. C++ code can only access the data values on [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect), for example **Left**. For C++ developers, approximately the same utility features that a Microsoft Visual Basic developer could use directly on [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect) are available in a static form on the RectHelper class.
