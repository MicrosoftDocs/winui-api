> For more info, design guidance, and code examples, see [Z-depth and shadow](/windows/apps/design/layout/depth-shadow).

Many common controls automatically cast shadows using a [ThemeShadow](../microsoft.ui.xaml.media/themeshadow.md). 

The UIElement.Shadow property can be used to cast shadows from additional visual elements or custom controls.
