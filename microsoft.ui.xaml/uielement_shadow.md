**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks

> [!TIP]
> For more info, design guidance, and code examples, see [Z-depth and shadow](/windows/apps/design/layout/depth-shadow).

Many common controls automatically cast shadows using a [ThemeShadow](../microsoft.ui.xaml.media/themeshadow.md). 

The UIElement.Shadow property can be used to cast shadows from additional visual elements or custom controls.
