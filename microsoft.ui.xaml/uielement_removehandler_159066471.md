# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.RemoveHandler

## -description
Removes the specified routed event handler from this [UIElement](uielement.md). Typically the handler in question was added by [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_1350394113.md).

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -parameters
### -param routedEvent
The identifier of the routed event for which the handler is attached.

### -param handler
The specific handler implementation to remove from the event handler collection on this [UIElement](uielement.md).

## -remarks
RemoveHandler can only be used for the event handlers of the events that are supported by [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_1350394113.md), which is approximately the input-specific events of [UIElement](uielement.md). More precisely, the event must have a ***Event** property of type [RoutedEvent](routedevent.md), which is true only of certain events on [UIElement](uielement.md). You cannot use RemoveHandler to unhook event handlers for Windows Runtime events on runtime class instances in general. Instead, you should use the specific event handler unhooking syntax: 
+ `-=` in C#
+ **RemoveHandler** in Microsoft Visual Basic
+ `-=` in VisualÂ C++ component extensions (C++/CX)

<!--

If more than one handler is attached that matched the criteria, only the first handler in the event handler store is removed. This behavior is consistent with CLR behavior of the -= operator.  

-->

Calling this method has no effect if there were no handlers registered with criteria that match the input parameters for the method call.

This method ignores whether *handledEventsToo* parameter was **true** in the [AddHandler](uielement_addhandler_1350394113.md) call that originally attached the handler.
