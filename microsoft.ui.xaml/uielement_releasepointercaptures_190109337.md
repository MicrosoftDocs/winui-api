# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.UIElement.ReleasePointerCaptures

## -description

Releases all pointer captures held by this element.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks

Because there are input scenarios such as manipulations that involve more than one pointer point, the Windows Runtime enables capturing more than one pointer at a time. Calling [ReleasePointerCapture](uielement_releasepointercapture_851958174.md) removes a specific [Pointer](../microsoft.ui.xaml.input/pointer.md) from the collection as identified by its ID, whereas ReleasePointerCaptures clears the entire collection.

User action that invalidates pointer capture such as releasing from a pointer point also changes capture state. For more info, see [Mouse interactions](/windows/uwp/input-and-devices/mouse-interactions) and [Handle pointer input](/windows/apps/design/input/handle-pointer-input).

The [PointerCaptures](uielement_pointercaptures.md) property exposes a view of which pointer points are currently captured by the [UIElement](uielement.md).
