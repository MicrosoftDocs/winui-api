# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.FrameworkElement.ArrangeOverride

## -description
Provides the behavior for the "Arrange" pass of layout. Classes can override this method to define their own "Arrange" pass behavior.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -parameters
### -param finalSize
The final area within the parent that this object should use to arrange itself and its children.

## -returns
The actual size that is used after the element is arranged in layout.

## -remarks
This method has a default implementation that performs built-in layout for most [FrameworkElement](frameworkelement.md) derived classes. ArrangeOverride provides the behavior for [Arrange](uielement_arrange_958316931.md), whenever [Arrange](uielement_arrange_958316931.md) is called either by internal layout logic or your own app's code, including any ArrangeOverride methods of your own for other classes. If you are producing a templated control, the ArrangeOverride logic defines your control's specific "Arrange" pass layout logic.

The general design of how elements go through a layout process when your app runs is divided into two steps: a "Measure" pass, and then an "Arrange" pass. Control authors (or panel authors) who want to customize the "Arrange" pass of layout processing should override ArrangeOverride. The implementation pattern should call [Arrange](uielement_arrange_958316931.md) on each visible child object, and pass the final desired size for each child object as the *finalRect* parameter. If [Arrange](uielement_arrange_958316931.md) isn't called, the child object is not rendered.

Several existing non-sealed classes provide override implementations of this method. Prominent ones include [StackPanel](../microsoft.ui.xaml.controls/stackpanel.md) and [Grid](../microsoft.ui.xaml.controls/grid.md). Typically, the behavior of ArrangeOverride produces a *finalSize* that does not violate any user-defined values that are placed on the layout container itself. For example, the *finalSize* is not typically larger than the container's [Height](frameworkelement_height.md) and [Width](frameworkelement_width.md), accounting for **Margin** or **Padding** values that affect the content area. Controls that specifically have a scenario for exceeding the container size could return a larger value, but anyone using that control must account for the clipping and positioning issues that result from it. The value that an ArrangeOverride implementation passes to [Arrange](uielement_arrange_958316931.md) for each child object is generally the value that is set in [DesiredSize](uielement_desiredsize.md) by the previous [Measure](uielement_measure_1722732750.md) call.

## -examples
This example implements ArrangeOverride to customize the "Arrange" pass logic for a custom panel implementation. Note in particular these aspects of the code:


+ Iterates over children.
+ For each child, calls [Arrange](uielement_arrange_958316931.md), using a [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect) where **Height** and **Width** are based on [DesiredSize](uielement_desiredsize.md), and **X** and **Y** are based on logic that is specific to the panel.
+ Returns its size (in this case, this simple panel returns a fixed size rather than a size calculated on accumulating the arranged [Rect](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.rect) value measurements).
