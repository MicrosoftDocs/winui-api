# TextLineBounds

## -description
Influences how a line box height is calculated

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -enum-fields
### -field Full:0
Uses normal line box height calculation, this is the default.

### -field TrimToCapHeight:1
Top of line box height is the cap height from the font.

### -field TrimToBaseline:2
Bottom of line box height is the text baseline.

### -field Tight:3
Top of line box height is the cap height from the font, bottom of line box height is the text baseline.


## -remarks
How the TextLineBounds values influence line height calculations for adjacent lines is best shown through illustrations. The first illustration for each value shows a single line and the second shows two adjacent lines and their bounds.
+ Yellow areas represent the areas that are outside of a [TextBlock](../microsoft.ui.xaml.controls/textblock.md) outer boundary, and would thus be masked if there was adjacent content (text or otherwise).
+ The red line is the text cap height, which text ascenders might go above. The upper-case "Ã‚" character in the illustrations has an ascender.
+ The green line is the text baseline, which text descenders might go below. The lower-case "j" character in the illustrations has a descender.

Note that for the **Tight** alignment there is a strong possibility that characters are overlapped if there are any ascenders or descenders. Especially if the different lines of characters use the same **Foreground** value, the overlap can negatively impact readability.
