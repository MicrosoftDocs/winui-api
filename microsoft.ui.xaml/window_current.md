# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Window.Current

## -description

For UWP apps, gets the window of the current thread. Desktop apps always return null.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -property-value

The currently activated window for UWP apps. Null for Desktop apps.

## -remarks

The value of this property depends on the thread from which it is called. If called from a UI thread of a UWP app, the value is the Window instance for that thread. On any other thread, the value is null.

The [Window](window.md) object implements [IWindowNative](/windows/apps/winui/reference/iwindownative), through which Desktop apps can get the underlying HWND of the window.
