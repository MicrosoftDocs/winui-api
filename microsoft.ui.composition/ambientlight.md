AmbientLight is one of the four light types derived from [CompositionLight](compositionlight.md).

| Light | Description |
|---|---|
| AmbientLight | A light source that emits non directional light that appears to have been reflected by everything in the scene. |
| [DistantLight](distantlight.md) | An infinitely large distant light source that emits light in a single direction. |
| [PointLight](pointlight.md) | A point source of light that emits light in all directions. |
| [SpotLight](spotlight.md) | A light source that emits inner and outer cones of light. |


> [!NOTE]
> A Visual cannot be targeted by more than two non-ambient lights (PointLight, SpotLight or DistantLight).
