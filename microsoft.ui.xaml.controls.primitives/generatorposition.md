# GeneratorPosition

## -description
GeneratorPosition is used to describe the position of an item that is managed by [ItemContainerGenerator](../microsoft.ui.xaml.controls/itemcontainergenerator.md).

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -struct-fields

### -field Index
The index that is relative to the generated (realized) items.
    

### -field Offset
The offset that is relative to the ungenerated (unrealized) items near the indexed item.
    

## -remarks
### Projection and members of GeneratorPosition

If you are using a Microsoft .NET language (C# or Microsoft Visual Basic), then GeneratorPosition has non-data members available, and its data members are exposed as read-write properties, not fields.

If you are programming with C++, then only the data member fields exist as members of GeneratorPosition, and you cannot use the utility methods or properties listed in the members table. C++ code can access similar utility methods that exist on the [GeneratorPositionHelper](generatorpositionhelper.md) class.
