# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Primitives.InfoBarPanel.HorizontalOrientationMargin

<!--
see GetHorizontalOrientationMargin, and SetHorizontalOrientationMargin
-->


## -description

The margin of the [InfoBarPanel](infobarpanel.md) when its items are horizontally aligned. This property is reserved for internal use and is not intended to be used in your code.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks
The HorizontalOrientationMargin is applied on an element in addition to the element's Margin property.

However, the leading and trailing margins are ignored. The HorizontalOrientationMargin.Left is ignored on the first child, and the HorizontalOrientationMargin.Right is ignored on the last child. This applies to the first/last child that are not collapsed (that take up layout space). For example, if the first child is collapsed, it's the HorizontalOrientationMargin.Left of the second child that is ignored.
