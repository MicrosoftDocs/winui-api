# Windows UI Library namespaces

## -description

This section provides detailed API reference information for the Windows UI Library (WinUI) APIs that ship as **WinUI 2**.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> For WinUI APIs in the Windows App SDK, see the [Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/).

[WinUI 2](/windows/apps/winui/winui2/) is a library of official native Microsoft UI controls and features (tightly integrated with [Windows 10 and later SDKs](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)) for [Universal Windows Platform (UWP)](/windows/uwp/) apps. WinUI 2 can be used in any Windows 10 UWP XAML app, desktop application through [XAML Islands](/windows/apps/desktop/modernize/xaml-islands), or in a Xamarin.Forms app running on Windows 10 using native view embedding.

For links to the APIs, see the [Namespaces](#namespaces) section below. Select the WinUI version using the drop down above the API reference TOC.
