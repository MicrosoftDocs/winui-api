# Windows UI Library namespaces

## -description

The Windows UI Library (WinUI) is a native user experience (UX) framework for both Windows Desktop and Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications.

There are two versions of WinUI that ship as NuGet packages: **WinUI 2** and **WinUI 3**. See the [Windows UI Library overview](/windows/apps/winui/) for more details on both.

The namespaces and APIs documented here are valid for both versions.

          WinUI 3 can be used in all desktop (.NET and native Win32) apps.<br/><br/>
          Download and install the [Windows App SDK VSIX package](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ProjectReunion.MicrosoftProjectReunion) to add both the WinUI 3 project templates and the NuGet package containing the WinUI 3 libraries to Visual Studio. For more details, see [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/stable-channel).

    :::column:::
          WinUI 2 can be used in UWP apps, or Win32 apps through XAML Islands.<br/><br/>
          Install the WinUI 2 NuGet package through the Visual Studio NuGet Package Manager. For more details, see [Getting started with the Windows UI 2 Library](/windows/apps/winui/winui2/getting-started).

## -examples

> [!TIP]
> The **WinUI 3 Gallery** and **WinUI 2 Gallery** apps include interactive examples of most WinUI 3 and WinUI 2 controls, features, and functionality.
>
> If installed already, open them by clicking the following links: [**WinUI 3 Gallery**](winui3gallery:) or [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](winui2gallery:).
>
> If they are not installed, you can get the [**WinUI 3 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/p/winui-3-controls-gallery/9p3jfpwwdzrc) and the [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt) from the Microsoft Store.
>
> You can also view, clone, and build both from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinUI-Gallery) (use the *main* branch for WinUI 3 controls and features and the *winui2* branch for WinUI 2 controls and features).
