# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Automation.Peers

## -description

Defines support types for the [Microsoft UI Automation](/windows/win32/winauto/entry-uiauto-win32) infrastructure.

> [!NOTE]
> This namespace requires the **Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls** NuGet package, a part of the [Microsoft Windows UI Library](https://aka.ms/winui-docs).

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -remarks

WinUI controls, and other UI elements, implement UI Automation support to report roles and values. You can use UI Automation tools to examine the role and value information, or you can review the AutomationPeer implementations of each control. The available roles in a UI Automation framework are defined in the [AutomationControlType](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Automation.Peers.AutomationControlType) enumeration. UI Automation clients, such as assistive technologies, can obtain role information by calling methods that the UI Automation framework exposes through the control's AutomationPeer.
