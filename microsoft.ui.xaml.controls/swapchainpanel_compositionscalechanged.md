# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.SwapChainPanel.CompositionScaleChanged

## -description
Occurs when the composition scale factor of the [SwapChainPanel](swapchainpanel.md) has changed.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<SwapChainPanel CompositionScaleChanged="eventhandler"/>
```


## -remarks
The supplier of the swap chain content might need to resize their content if a layout pass determines a new size for the panel or containers it's within, or if a [RenderTransform](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_rendertransform.md) is applied on the [SwapChainPanel](swapchainpanel.md) or any of its ancestors. Changes of this nature aren't always originated by app logic that's easy to detect from other events (for example the user might change a device orientation or a view state that causes layout to rerun), so this event provides a notification specifically for the scenario of changing the swap chain content size, which would typically invert the scale factors applied.

Check [CompositionScaleX](swapchainpanel_compositionscalex.md) and [CompositionScaleY](swapchainpanel_compositionscaley.md) any time you are handling CompositionScaleChanged (CompositionScaleChanged doesn't have event data, but if it fires it means that one or both properties have changed values on this [SwapChainPanel](swapchainpanel.md)).

This event fires asynchronously versus the originating change. For example, dynamic animations or manipulations might affect the scale factor, and the event is raised when those dynamic changes are completed.
