# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ItemsSourceView

<!--
public class ItemsSourceView : System.Collections.Specialized.INotifyCollectionChanged
-->

## -description

Represents a standardized view of the supported interactions between a given ItemsSource object and an ItemsRepeater control.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -remarks

Components written to work with [ItemsRepeater](itemsrepeater.md) should consume the [ItemsSource](itemsrepeater_itemssource.md) via ItemsSourceView since this provides a normalized view of the ItemsSource. That way, each component does not need to know if the source is an [IEnumerable](/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1?view=dotnet-uwp-10.0&preserve-view=true), an [IVector](/uwp/api/windows.foundation.collections.ivector_t_), or something else.
