# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.IconSource

## -description

Represents the base class for an icon source.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks

**IconSource** is similar to [IconElement](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.iconelement). However, because it is not a [FrameworkElement](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.frameworkelement), it can be shared.

### IconSource derived classes

**IconSource** is the parent class for these classes:

+ [BitmapIconSource](bitmapiconsource.md)
+ [FontIconSource](fonticonsource.md)
+ [PathIconSource](pathiconsource.md)
+ [SymbolIconSource](symboliconsource.md)
