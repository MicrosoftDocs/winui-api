Represents a control that displays a header and has a collapsible body that displays content.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks

> [!TIP]
> For more info, design guidance, and code examples, see [Expander overview](/windows/apps/design/controls/expander).

Use an `Expander` to focus on the most important content when display space is limited. The `Expander` control lets you show or hide less important content that's related to a piece of primary content that's always visible. Items contained in the [Header](/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.expander.header) are always visible. The user can expand and collapse the [Content](/uwp/api/microsoft.ui.xaml.controls.expander.content) area, where secondary content is displayed, by interacting with the header. When the content area is expanded, it pushes other UI elements out of the way; it does not overlay other UI. The `Expander` can expand upwards or downwards.

Both the `Header` and `Content` areas can contain any content, from simple text to complex UI layouts.

### Control style and template

You can modify the default [Style](../microsoft.ui.xaml/style.md) and [ControlTemplate](controltemplate.md) to give the control a unique appearance. For information about modifying a control's style and template, see [Styling controls](/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/styling-controls). The default style, template, and resources that define the look of the control are included in the generic.xaml file. For design purposes, generic.xaml is available in the \(Program Files)\Windows Kits\10\DesignTime\CommonConfiguration\Neutral\UAP\ &lt;SDK version&gt;\Generic folder from a Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) installation. Styles and resources from different versions of the SDK might have different values.

Starting in WindowsÂ 10, version 1607 (SDK 14393), generic.xaml includes resources that you can use to modify the colors of a control in different visual states without modifying the control template. In apps that target this software development kit (SDK) or later, modifying these resources is preferred to setting properties such as [Background](control_background.md) and [Foreground](control_foreground.md). For more info, see the [Light-weight styling](/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/styling-controls) section of the [Styling controls](/windows/uwp/controls-and-patterns/styling-controls) article.
