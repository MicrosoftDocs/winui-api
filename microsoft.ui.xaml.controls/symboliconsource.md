# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.SymbolIconSource

## -description

Represents an icon source that uses a glyph from the Segoe MDL2 Assets font as its content.

## -remarks

**SymbolIconSource** is similar to [SymbolIcon](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.symbolicon). However, because it is not a [FrameworkElement](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.frameworkelement), it can be shared.

## -see-also

[BitmapIconSource](bitmapiconsource.md), [FontIconSource](fonticonsource.md), [PathIconSource](pathiconsource.md)

## -examples

See the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app for examples of WinUI features and controls.

If you have the **XAML Controls Gallery** app installed, [open the app to see the controls in action](xamlcontrolsgallery:).

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 Preview branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for WinUI 3 Preview controls and features).
