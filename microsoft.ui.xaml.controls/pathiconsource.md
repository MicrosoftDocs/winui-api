# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.PathIconSource

## -description

Represents an icon source that uses a vector path as its content.

## -remarks

**PathIconSource** is similar to [PathIcon](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.pathicon). However, because it is not a [FrameworkElement](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.frameworkelement), it can be shared.

## -examples

> [!TIP]
> For more info, design guidance, and code examples, see [Icons for Windows apps](/windows/apps/design/style/icons).
>
> The **WinUI 3 Gallery** and **WinUI 2 Gallery** apps include interactive examples of most WinUI 3 and WinUI 2 controls, features, and functionality.
>
> If installed already, open them by clicking the following links: [**WinUI 3 Gallery**](winui3gallery:/item/IconElement) or [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](winui2gallery:/item/IconElement).
>
> If they are not installed, you can download the [**WinUI 3 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P3JFPWWDZRC) and the [**WinUI 2 Gallery**](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9MSVH128X2ZT) from the Microsoft Store.
>
> You can also get the source code for both from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/WinUI-Gallery) (use the *main* branch for WinUI 3 and the *winui2* branch for WinUI 2).
