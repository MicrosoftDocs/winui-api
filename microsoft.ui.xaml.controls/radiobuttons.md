![Example of a RadioButtons group, with one radio button selected](images/radiobuttons/radiobuttons-default-group.png)

Use radio buttons, also called option buttons, to let users select one option from a collection of two or more mutually exclusive, but related, options. Radio buttons are always used in groups, and each option is represented by one radio button in the group.

The `RadioButtons` control simplifies layout, handles keyboard navigation and accessibility, and supports binding to a data source. When you use RadioButtons, you can treat your group of options as a single entity, rather than keeping track of individual [RadioButton](/uwp/api/Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.RadioButton) controls.

The `RadioButtons` control uses a content model similar to an [ItemsControl](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.itemscontrol). This means that you can:

- Populate it by adding items directly to the [Items](radiobuttons_items.md) collection or by binding data to its [ItemsSource](radiobuttons_itemssource.md) property.
- Use the [SelectedIndex](radiobuttons_selectedindex.md) or [SelectedItem](radiobuttons_selecteditem.md) properties to get and set which option is selected.
- Handle the [SelectionChanged](radiobuttons_selectionchanged.md) event to take action when an option is chosen.
