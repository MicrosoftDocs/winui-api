# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.AnimatedIconSource.MirroredWhenRightToLeft

<!--
public bool MirroredWhenRightToLeft { get; set; }
-->

## -description

Gets or sets a value that indicates whether the icon is mirrored when the [FlowDirection](../microsoft.ui.xaml/flowdirection.md) is **RightToLeft**.

## -property-value

True, if the icon is mirrored when the [FlowDirection](../microsoft.ui.xaml/flowdirection.md) is **RightToLeft**. Otherwise, false. The default is false.

## -remarks

You can set the [MirroredWhenRightToLeft](animatedicon_mirroredwhenrighttoleft.md) property to have the glyph appear mirrored when the [FlowDirection](../microsoft.ui.xaml/flowdirection.md) is **RightToLeft**. You typically use this property when an AnimatedIcon is used as part of a control template and the icon needs to be mirrored along with the rest of the control.
