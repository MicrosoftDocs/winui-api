## -examples

See the **XAML Controls Gallery** sample app for examples of WinUI features and controls.

If you have the **XAML Controls Gallery** app installed, see the [TeachingTip](xamlcontrolsgallery:/item/TeachingTip) in action.

If you don't have the XAML Controls Gallery app installed, get the WinUI 2.x version from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/p/xaml-controls-gallery/9msvh128x2zt).

You can also view, clone, and build the XAML Controls Gallery source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery) (switch to the [WinUI 3 Preview branch](https://github.com/microsoft/Xaml-Controls-Gallery/tree/winui3preview) for WinUI 3 Preview controls and features).
