## -description

A teaching tip is a notification flyout used to provide contextually relevant information. It supports rich content (including titles, subtitles, icons, images, and text) and can be configured for either explicit or light-dismiss.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks

Teaching tips are often used for informing, reminding, and teaching users about new or important features that might enhance their experience.
