# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.RowDefinition.Height

## -description
Gets the calculated height of a [RowDefinition](rowdefinition.md) element, or sets the [GridLength](../microsoft.ui.xaml/gridlength.md) value of a row that is defined by the [RowDefinition](rowdefinition.md). This is the [content property](../microsoft.ui.xaml.markup/contentpropertyattribute.md) of RowDefinition. 

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** for [WinUI]/windows/apps/winui/winui3/ in the [Windows App SDK]/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/, see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces]/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/**.

## -xaml-syntax
```xaml
<RowDefinition Height="doubleValue"/>
- or -
<RowDefinition Height="starSizing"/>
-or-
<RowDefinition Height="Auto"/>
```


## -xaml-values
<dl><dt>doubleValue</dt><dd>doubleValueThe row's height, expressed as a floating-point value for a pixel count. Typically this is specified as an integer, although interpolation of floating-point values is supported by grid layout.</dd>
<dt>starSizing</dt><dd>starSizingA convention by which you can size rows or columns to take the remaining available space in a Grid. A star sizing always includes the asterisk character (\*), and optionally precedes the asterisk with an integer value that specifies a weighted factor versus other possible star sizings (for example, 3\*). For more information about star sizing, see Grid.</dd>
<dt>Auto</dt><dd>AutoThe row's height, described by the literal Auto. For more information about Auto sizing, see Grid.</dd>
</dl>
## -property-value
The [GridLength](../microsoft.ui.xaml/gridlength.md) that represents the height of the row. The default value is a [GridLength](../microsoft.ui.xaml/gridlength.md) representing a "1\*" sizing.

## -remarks
The default value of [Width](columndefinition_width.md) is a [GridLength](../microsoft.ui.xaml/gridlength.md) representing a "1\*" sizing. This structure value has a **Value** data value of 1.0, and a **GridUnitType** data value of **Star**. With this default, each new [RowDefinition](rowdefinition.md) you define for a [Grid](grid.md) will have "1\*" sizing, and each will be allotted an equal number of pixels for height of its content in layout handling. It's not uncommon to define [RowDefinition](rowdefinition.md) as an object element in XAML without any attributes set and to just use this default behavior. The same is true for [ColumnDefinition](columndefinition.md).

The value you set for Height can be constrained if you also set a value for [MinHeight](rowdefinition_minheight.md) or [MaxHeight](rowdefinition_maxheight.md). Each of these properties can take only pixel measurements, not **Star** sizing. If a [RowDefinition](rowdefinition.md) uses **Star** or **Auto** sizing but also has [MinHeight](rowdefinition_minheight.md) or [MaxHeight](rowdefinition_maxheight.md) constraints, the [MinHeight](rowdefinition_minheight.md) or [MaxHeight](rowdefinition_maxheight.md) must be honored by the [Grid](grid.md) layout behavior, even if that means giving or taking layout space from other **Star** sizing rows defined in the [Grid](grid.md) that don't have constraints.

It's more common to use **Star** sizing than absolute pixel values for a [Grid](grid.md) definition in a UWP app using C++, C#, or Visual Basic. **Star** sizing supports the dynamic layout concept, which helps your app look great on screens with different sizes, pixel densities and orientations.
