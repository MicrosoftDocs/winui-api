# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.DropDownButton

## -description

Represents a button that includes a chevron to indicate a menu can be opened.

## -remarks

The chevron is a visual indicator that a flyout is available with a menu of options. The DropDownButton has the same behavior as a standard Button with a flyout (only the appearance is different).
