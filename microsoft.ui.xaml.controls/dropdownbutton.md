# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.DropDownButton

## -description

Represents a button that includes a chevron to indicate a menu can be opened.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks

The chevron is a visual indicator that a flyout is available with a menu of options. The DropDownButton has the same behavior as a standard Button with a flyout (only the appearance is different).

For more info and examples, see [Buttons](/windows/apps/design/controls/buttons#create-a-drop-down-button).
