# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Control.OnRightTapped

## -description
Called before the [RightTapped](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_righttapped.md) event occurs.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -parameters
### -param e
Event data for the event.

## -remarks
This event is not implemented in a [MapControl](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.maps.mapcontrol).

### Windows 8 behavior

Windows 8 had an issue with the data for the [RightTapped](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_righttapped.md) event, where the **X** and **Y** values for the point you'd get from [RightTappedRoutedEventArgs.GetPosition](/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.input.righttappedroutedeventargs.getposition(windows.ui.xaml.uielement)) were reversed (**X** was really **Y**; **Y** was really **X**). This issue has been fixed starting with Windows 8.1. But if you're retargeting a Windows 8 app for Windows 8.1, you might have had code that worked around this issue by swapping the **X** and **Y** back. If so, remove that code when you retarget because the issue is now fixed.

Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 continue to use the Windows 8 behavior.

Also, Windows 8 didn't include default key handling for Shift+F10 that would fire this event and then display context menus. Shift+F10 is typically a secondary key combination for the VK_APP virtual key value (the Properties key), and thus Shift+F10 might be expected to fire [RightTapped](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_righttapped.md) too. This issue has been fixed starting with Windows 8.1; Shift+F10 now fires [RightTapped](../microsoft.ui.xaml/uielement_righttapped.md). You can see this change as default event handling on some controls that have default context menus for text, such as [TextBox](textbox.md), or when invoking custom menus and flyouts.

Apps that were compiled for Windows 8 but running on Windows 8.1 do not use this Windows 8 behavior, they use the corrected Windows 8.1 behavior.
