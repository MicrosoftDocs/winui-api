# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.ProgressBarTemplateSettings

<!--
public class ProgressBarTemplateSettings : Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyObject
-->

## -description

Provides calculated values that can be referenced as **TemplatedParent** sources when defining templates for a [ProgressBar](progressbar.md) control. Not intended for general use.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -remarks

Get instances of ProgressBarTemplateSettings by querying the value of [ProgressBar.TemplateSettings](progressbar_templatesettings.md).

The values from ProgressBarTemplateSettings are typically used as either the "To" or "From" values of theme animations or transitions.
