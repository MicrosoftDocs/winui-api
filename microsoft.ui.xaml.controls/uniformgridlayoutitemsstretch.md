## -description

Defines constants that specify how items are sized to fill the available space.

**This documentation applies to WinUI 2 for UWP** (for [WinUI](/windows/apps/winui/winui3/) in the [Windows App SDK](/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/), see the **[Windows App SDK namespaces](/windows/windows-app-sdk/api/winrt/)**).

## -enum-fields

### -field Uniform

The item is sized to both fill the available space in the non-scrolling direction and maintain its aspect ratio.

## -remarks

This enumeration provides values for the [UniformGrid.ItemsStretch](uniformgridlayout_itemsstretch.md) property.
