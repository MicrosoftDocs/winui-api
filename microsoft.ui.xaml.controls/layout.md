# Microsoft.UI.Xaml.Controls.Layout

<!--
public class Layout : Windows.UI.Xaml.DependencyObject
-->

## -description

Represents the base class for an object that sizes and arranges child elements for a host.

## -remarks

You should not use or inherit from the Layout class directly. Instead, inherit from its derived classes, [NonVirtualizingLayout](nonvirtualizinglayout.md) or [VirtualizingLayout](virtualizinglayout.md).

Provided concrete layout classes are [FlowLayout](flowlayout.md), [StackLayout](stacklayout.md), and [UniformGridLayout](uniformgridlayout.md).
