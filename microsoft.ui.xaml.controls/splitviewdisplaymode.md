### -field CompactOverlay:2
The amount of the pane defined by the [CompactPaneLength](splitview_compactpanelength.md) property is shown side-by-side with the content and takes up space in the control layout. The remaining part of the pane covers the content when it's open and does not take up space in the control layout. The pane closes when the user taps outside of it.

### -field CompactInline:3
The amount of the pane defined by the [CompactPaneLength](splitview_compactpanelength.md) property is shown side-by-side with the content and takes up space in the control layout.
